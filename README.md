# TS-chart-Matplotlib
Here are the redefined Matplotlib charts for time series dataset, differentiate by Weekly based and showing the wrapped chart on top of another.

I have created the charts which are easy to identify the pattern of the daa point in Weekly basis, this will give you an idea 
about the how data points are distributed and weekly how they changed etc.
