# TS-chart-Matplotlib
Here are the redefined Matplotlib charts for time series dataset, differentiate by Weekly based and showing the wrapped chart on top of another.

I have created the charts which are easy to identify the pattern of the data points in Weekly basis, by looking at this kind of charts you can get an idea about how data points are distributed and how they changing weekly , that will make easy of prediction etc.
